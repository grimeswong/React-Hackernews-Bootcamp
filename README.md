# React Bootcamp by Tanda

> Build a Hacker News clone

Welcome to the first React Bootcamp that we've hosted at Tanda.

A few things to get you started:

- At a minimum, you will need [`node`](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer, so we can run our tools. Ideally 8.9.4 (the most recent LTS). We haven't tested on anything other than that.
- You'll also need something to write your code in. Anything will do, but we recommend (and will support) the use of [`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is a brilliant text editor by Microsoft. It's built using JavaScript specifically for JavaScript.
- We also use `yarn` for dependency management (more explained in `chapters/zero.md`), which you can install with `npm i -g yarn`, providing you have `node` installed.

This course is broken into chapters. You can find them in the `chapters` folder, starting at `zero.md`.
Once you finish a chapter, your code will be in the correct state to move onto the next chapter.
Each chapter is also a `branch` on [`git`](https://git-scm.com/). You don't need to know how to use `git` to do the bootcamp, but it may come in handy.

When you complete the work from `chapters/zero.md`, your code will be in the same state as `chapter-one` in the repository, and so on. If this makes no sense to you, don't worry! We'll help you out.

If you get stuck at any point, ask us for help. There are no bad questions! If you get truly stuck and want to start from a clean slate, the end of every chapter has a link to GitHub, which contains the code base as it should be for the start of the next chapter.

Each chapter contains an 'Exercise' at the end, which must be complete for the code to be in the same state as the next chapter. What you learn in a chapter should give you all the necessary knowledge to complete the exercise.

There are also 'Additional Exercises', which are marked like **_Additional Exercise_**. These are *not* required, and you do *not* need to keep any code you write for them. They're just there to solidify your knowledge.

We hope you have a lot of fun, and learn how to build a decent web application. Any questions, let us know!
